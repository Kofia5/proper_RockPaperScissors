The goal of this project is to explore current rails and HTML tech while 
creating the best possible Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) experience.

The first goal will be to create system for registering and logging users 
(authlogic?). 

Second, we will make a simple version of RPS: 1 player vs. 
a simple AI (just random selection), where each round is a full match.

Third, we will expand the game to allow multiple rounds per match. Players 
will be able to see the previous results of each of their own matches in 
a round by round viewer. Work will be done to improve the visual style of 
site (AJAX (jQuery?), HTML5, &c.)

Fourth, we will add tournament rules and plays (shouts, psychs, early shows,
 &c.). We might also attempt to improve the AI at this stage. Styling for
mobile will be done here.

Fifth, ...?
